## Critical systems that scale teams, not meetings.

I design and lead **stable, scalable, and maintainable software systems** in industrial and enterprise environments where failure is not an option. My work focuses on reducing complexity, technical debt, and friction between teams, so software enables progress in production instead of slowing the organization down.

---

### What I do

- Software architecture focused on real stability and scalability  
- Technical leadership and decision-making in critical environments  
- Evolution of legacy systems without unnecessary rewrites  

---

### How I work

- Prioritizing reliability and simplicity over fragile solutions  
- Designing architectures that reduce dependencies and unnecessary coordination  
- Making technical decisions with mid- and long-term impact in mind  

---

### Where I add the most value

- Critical systems and complex platforms  
- Industrial and enterprise environments  
- Teams that need stability in order to grow
