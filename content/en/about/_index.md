Many systems stop scaling not because of technical limits, but because every change requires more coordination, more meetings, and more dependencies between teams.

I am a **Software Architect and Technical Lead**, specialized in designing **stable, scalable, and maintainable systems** that allow teams to move forward without unnecessary friction. I combine technical responsibility with leadership to make decisions that reduce risk, technical debt, and operational complexity.

Over more than **20 years of experience**, I have designed, developed, and led critical software solutions in **enterprise and industrial environments** (automotive, industrial automation, energy, health, certification, and environmental sectors), where **reliability, security, and stability** are not optional.

I have taken on technical reference roles, leading teams, guiding architectural decisions, and stabilizing complex platforms. I enjoy turning challenging projects into sustainable solutions, optimizing processes, and enabling teams to focus on delivering real value.

I complement my experience with training in **Artificial Intelligence** and hands-on use of **Python** to integrate AI as a support and productivity tool in software development.

Always open to opportunities where I can contribute **technical leadership, solid architecture, and high-quality software development**.
